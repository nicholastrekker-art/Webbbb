## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with Quick Start buttons** for fastest setup with Google or Deriv
2. **Use standard viewport sizes** (1920x1080) for best compatibility
3. **Keep sessions running** to maintain state and cookies
4. **View cookies** to debug login or session issues
5. **Monitor the status** - sessions will show error state if something goes wrong

## Troubleshooting

### Session won't start
- Check that Chromium is installed (should be automatic)
- Verify the URL is valid and accessible
- Check the browser logs for error messages

### Can't interact with session
- Ensure the session status shows "running"
- Try refreshing the browser viewer
- Check that WebSocket connection is established

### Cookies not persisting
- Make sure the session remains "running"
- Cookies are automatically saved while the session is active
- View cookies to verify they're being stored
